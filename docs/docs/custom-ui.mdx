title: Customizing the UI
---

Features are continually being added to allow you to customize the node editor to fit your application. Version `0.7.0` or greater, brings the first of these features by allowing you to override the rendering of the header for each node.

## `renderNodeHeader`

The `renderNodeHeader` is a prop on the `<NodeEditor/>` component which allows you to customize the header for each node. Common use-cases might include overriding the label of a node, or adding custom UI elements like a button to delete the node, or open the node context menu.
